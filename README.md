# APC PDU Control

This plugin for the [Indigo Domotics](http://www.indigodomo.com/) home automation platform allows communication with a APC Power Distribution Unit (PDU) via Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)

This plugin has the ability to controls the On/Off/Reboot function of the PDU and should work with any of APC MasterSwitch devices.

## Supported Functions

* Turn On
* Turn Off
* Reboot
* Status Request
* Delayed Turn On
* Delayed Turn Off
* Delayed Reboot

You can also configured the On/Off/Reboot delays from the Plugin. The delays configured on the PDU, are shown as Custom States within the plugin.

## Configuration of your APC PDU

1) You must configure your APC PDU with appropriate Community Names. 

* Access Type read should be set to '  public  '
* Acces Type Write+ should be set to '  private  '

    Note: Write+ is preferred since it allows someone to be logged into the Web Portal and still allow Indigo to change an outlets state.
